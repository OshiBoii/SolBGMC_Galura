<h1> MyToken Contract </h1> 
A simple Solidity smart contract to demonstrate minting and burning tokens, while tracking balances for each address.

<h1> Description </h1>
This Solidity contract allows the creation of a token called "Silver" (SLVR) with functions to mint and burn tokens. 
<br> The contract keeps track of each user's balance using a mapping and ensures that users can only burn tokens they own.

<h1> Getting Started </h1>
<b> Installing </b>
<br> Clone the repository using:
<br> git clone https://github.com/OshiBoii/SolBGMC_Galura/blob/main/myToken.sol
<br> Make sure you have a Solidity environment like Remix IDE or Hardhat to compile and deploy the contract.

<br><b> Executing Program </b>
<br> Compile the Solidity code using:
<br> solc --optimize --bin MyToken.sol
<br> Deploy the contract to an Ethereum testnet (e.g., Rinkeby) using a compatible wallet like MetaMask and Remix IDE.

<h1> Help </h1>
For common issues:
<br> If the contract doesnâ€™t deploy properly, check if your Solidity version is compatible (^0.8.18).
<br> Ensure you have enough testnet Ether for deploying and interacting with the contract.
